Tasks
---------
- Implement 
  - kata.concurrency.testframework.api.Test
  - kata.concurrency.testframework.api.TestRunner.run
  - kata.concurrency.testframework.api.TestCase
- Add tests for the testframework api which demonstrates that concurrency is handled correctly.

Keep methods which are provided.  
Classes in kata.concurrency.tests are for showing the use case for the testframework api.
It can be extended, changed for better testing but the testframework api shouldn't be changed.

<b><u>Keep in mind that tests should run in parallel.</u></b>


Optional
-------
- Feel free to add some mocking for HTTP, e.g.: WireMock
